My coding journey began with Python, encompassing web scraping, data manipulation, analysis, visualization, video game creation, cybersecurity and exploration of quantum computing. Python's versatility as a key player in both front-end and back-end development has contributed to my proficiency in crafting dynamic user interfaces and interaction with website information. Beyond Python, I've ventured into data management, implementing TLS encryption and security hardening measures with SQL. I would like to explore languages like DAX and R for data analysis and statistical modeling. In recognizing the importance of JavaScript, I also aim to dive deeper into its capabilities, especially in web development. Additionally, I'm eager to explore the potential of languages like C#, C+, and C++, further enriching my skill set in the constantly evolving coding landscape.
